"""The character analyser: legs, arms, views and mouth chart, derived from the rig.

The first analyser (ADR 0005 first slice, item 2), shared with ADR 0002's first
slice: P7's capability registry adopts :func:`character_affordances` as
``affordances(asset)`` for characters instead of deriving a second time.

**What it reads is what the compiler reads**, or the facets would lie (ADR 0005,
Risks): the limb pairs ``walk`` resolves (:data:`cutan.motion.WALK_LEG_NAMES`,
:data:`cutan.motion.WALK_ARM_NAMES`), the ``view`` and ``viseme`` swap sets
(``asset_sets``), the declared facts ``rest_view``,
``face_overlay`` and ``occluded``. And **art must be present**: a slot or swap key counts only
when an attachment it names has its file among the asset's files — a descriptor
promising a side view whose drawing is missing does not afford one.

It is genre code (cut-out characters). It lives here until the genre package
exists (plan P8) and imports the cut-out modules lazily so ``import an.library``
stays free of them. **Importing it registers nothing** (P7): the cut-out genre
declares :data:`CHARACTER_CAPABILITIES` and :data:`CHARACTER_ANALYSER` in its
``capabilities`` and ``analysers`` fields (:data:`cutan.genre.CUTOUT`), so
they register with the genre, owned by it, and come out with it.
