"""Style lint: measure a render's cadence, cut rate and palette, and compare them to a style's targets.

"Make it in the style of X" is only checkable if X is a set of numbers. The
cut-out styles research (``misc/docs/cutout_styles_research.md``) measured six
styles with one fixed set of statistics; this module is that measurement,
ported, so an agent can render, measure the same statistics on its own output,
and adjust. The style specs that carry the ``targets`` ship with the package
(:mod:`cutan.styles`): pass a style's name (``"south_park"``), a path to a spec
file, or a mapping.

**The estimators are the research's estimators, on purpose — with one
measured exception.** Every threshold below is the one the six styles were
measured with, including the ones that are crude (a noise floor at the 10th
percentile of frame differences, a cut as a colour-histogram jump). A better
estimator measures a different quantity from the one the targets were
calibrated on, and a render would then pass or miss for a reason nobody
measured. Change an estimator only together with re-measuring the targets: the
local-change rule (an#255) did, and the cadence targets of every style spec
were re-measured on the six study clips with it (the table in
``misc/docs/cutout_styles_research.md`` §3). ``min_changed_pixels=0`` is the
research's original estimator, unchanged.

What is measured (see :data:`METRICS` for the vocabulary a spec's ``targets``
may use):

- **Holds and cadence.** A frame "changes" when its mean absolute grey
  difference from the previous frame exceeds ``max(0.25, 2.5 × p10)``, where
  p10 is the clip's own 10th-percentile difference (compression noise, capped
  at 1.0 — see :data:`NOISE_FLOOR_CAP`), **or** when at least
  :data:`MIN_CHANGED_PIXELS` of its pixels moved by more than
  :data:`PIXEL_CHANGE_DELTA` grey levels — a change measured on the area of
  the moving part, not the whole frame (an#255): a frame-wide mean cannot see
  a stick figure's shrug or a blink in a close-up, whose few changed pixels
  average to nothing. From
  that: the share of frames identical to the previous one, pose changes per
  second, and the histogram of gaps between successive changes (one frame = on
  ones, two = on twos, three or more = threes and holds, gaps above 12 frames
  ignored as holds rather than cadence).
- **Cuts and shot length.** For an ``an`` render the cuts are KNOWN — every shot
  boundary in the IR is a hard cut, because shots are concatenated — so the
  verifier takes them from the IR. Without an IR (any mp4), a cut is a frame
  whose 8×8×8 colour-histogram L1 distance exceeds 0.6 and whose mean
  difference exceeds 8; dissolves and morphs are missed, so on such footage the
  count is a floor.
- **Palette.** Mean HSV saturation, the share of dark pixels (every channel
  below 60, an outline proxy), and the coverage of the 16 most common colours
  after 4-bit quantisation (flatness), all on every 15th frame.

Not ported, deliberately: the research also measured global camera motion
(``cv2.phaseCorrelate``) and a k-means palette. Both need OpenCV or
scikit-learn, and this module adds no dependency — numpy and the ffmpeg binary
are already what ``an.verify.media`` uses.

A pure function over frames — :func:`measure_style` — is the core, so it is
testable without ffmpeg:

>>> import numpy as np
>>> still = np.zeros((4, 8, 8, 3), np.uint8)
>>> frames = np.concatenate([still, still + 200, still + 200, still])  # 16 frames, changes at 4 and 12
>>> m = measure_style(frames, fps=4.0, shot_durations=[4.0])
>>> m.identical_frame_share, m.pose_changes_per_s
(0.867, 0.5)

A target is a ``[low, high]`` range; a miss is a warning naming the knob that
moves it:

>>> findings = check_targets(m, {"identical_frame_share": [0.2, 0.5]})
>>> findings[0].severity, findings[0].ir_path
('warning', '<style>/identical_frame_share')
>>> check_targets(m, {"identical_frame_share": [0.5, 0.9]})
[]

A target nothing measures is refused, not ignored — a spec that silently checks
less than it says is worse than one that fails to load:

>>> check_targets(m, {"camera_shake": [0, 1]})
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: unknown style target 'camera_shake'; measurable targets are [...]
