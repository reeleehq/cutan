"""Character descriptor schema (Spine-shaped, Pydantic v2).

A character on disk lives at::

    characters/<name>/
        <name>.svg              # optional canonical layered SVG
        character.json          # CharacterDescriptor as JSON
        parts/
            head.svg
            torso.svg
            arm_l.svg, arm_r.svg
            leg_l.svg, leg_r.svg
            eye_l_open.svg, eye_l_closed.svg, eye_r_open.svg, eye_r_closed.svg
            brow_l.svg, brow_r.svg
            mouth/mouth_a.svg … mouth_h.svg, mouth_x.svg

The descriptor borrows Spine's separation of concerns:

- **bones** — where things attach. Local transforms relative to a parent.
- **slots** — what is drawn at each bone (one attachment active at a time).
- **skins** — for each slot, the named attachments and their SVG paths.
- **asset_sets** — ``{channel: {key: attachment_name}}``. What a swap key
  *selects*, layered over ``skins``, which says what art *exists*. The
  ``viseme`` channel is Rhubarb's shape letter → an attachment on the ``mouth``
  slot. (Replaced ``viseme_map`` in schema 0.2.0.)
- **animations** — built-in idle loops (breath, blink) keyed by name.

A slot's name **is** its scene-graph node name, which is why the face slots read
``left_eye`` rather than ``eye_l``; attachment names are a separate, per-slot
namespace — file-derived for single-attachment slots, and shared key-like names
(``open``/``closed`` on both eye slots, 0.3.0) where one swap set must drive
several slots.

VISEME_CHANNEL: str = "viseme"

#: The swap channel blinks drive. One set serves BOTH eye slots because the
#: eye slots share per-slot attachment names (`open` / `closed`) — the 0.3.0
