"""The cut-out genre's methods and aspects, and their compile-time resolution (ADR 0002).

The first two aspects of ADR 0002's first slice, as registry data:

=============  ==============================================  =====================  ==========
aspect         method (spelled)                                requires               chain

locomotion     ``loco.rock`` (``rock``)                        nothing                last link
speech         ``speech.mouth_chart`` (``mouth_chart``)        ``face.mouth``         1st
speech         ``speech.pose_only`` (``pulse``)                nothing                last link

=============  ==============================================  =====================  ==========

**Locomotion is today's walk/gait chain, moved, not changed** (ADR 0002
decision 8: the gate is byte-identical output). A walk's ``gait`` arg is the
author's request, the descriptor's ``gait`` a declared override (reported as
such); with neither, the chain picks ``legs`` when the character affords a leg
pair and ``rock`` when it does not — exactly what :func:`an.motion.walk` did on
its own. What is new is that the choice is the registry's, made once, and a
requested gait the rig cannot honour (``hem`` on a legless blob) is a
**recorded substitution**: a warning, fatal under ``--strict-assets``.

**Speech gains a requirement-free last link.** A character whose face is baked
into its art (``face_overlay: false``) used to speak with a frozen mouth; it now
pulses its head on each syllable (:func:`an.motion.speech_pulse`, parametrised:
``strength``, ``part``, ``attack``, ``release``; ``strength: 0`` is a mime).

**Expression names what reads when the brows cannot** (an#252). A hat the
factory could not seat above the brows (recorded in ``occluded``), or brow
slots without art, leave ``face.brows`` unafforded: the face then acts with
the lids, the gaze and the mouth form (``expr.without_brows``), recorded. Both
methods compile to the same face channels — the solver drives whatever the
rig binds — so the aspect is not consulted by the compiler; ``an validate``
reports the fall (:func:`check_brow_acting`) and ``an character
capabilities`` shows it with the remedy.

The asset profile the compiler resolves against is the character analyser's
(``an.capabilities.affordances``), fed what the compiler actually has: the
descriptor and the art its store holds, or — for a rig drawn from ``parts`` or
the placeholder — the parts the builder built. Characters only: other entity
kinds have no analyser yet, and keep the preset's own rig lookup.

Importing this module registers nothing: :data:`cutan.genre.CUTOUT` lists
:data:`CUTOUT_METHODS` and :data:`CUTOUT_ASPECTS`.

    The one resolution decides both halves: a speaker resolved to anything but
    ``speech.mouth_chart`` gets no viseme channel (:attr:`SpeechPlan.no_lip_sync`),
    and one resolved to ``speech.pose_only`` gets a ``speech_pulse`` play at each

    than overwriting it; a syllable that starts while the speaker's previous pulse
    is still running is skipped, so the head always settles back. ``strength: 0``
    is a mime: no pulse at all. An authored ``play: speech_pulse`` on the speaker
    replaces the automatic pulses (nothing is added beside it), but it is not a
    declaration: the fall from the mouth chart is still recorded, and only a
    declared ``speech`` makes it the request. Substitutions (a declared method
    the rig cannot honour; the fall from the mouth chart to the pulse) go to
    ``record``, once per speaker. A declared ``speech`` naming no method of the
