"""Resolve a ``play`` against a character descriptor — the renderer-free half (an#7).

A :class:`~an.ir.schema.PlayAction` names a descriptor animation. Its tracks
speak the DESCRIPTOR's vocabulary — bones, slots, attachment names, view-box
units, degrees — while the renderer's channels speak the SCENE's: node paths,
swap-set keys, scene pixels, radians. This module does everything on the
descriptor side of that line and knows no renderer, so that ``an validate``
and the cutout compiler share ONE verdict on whether a play can resolve. The
compiler used to decide alone, and validate passed plays that compile then
refused — four measured cases: an unknown bone property, a bone with no slot
of its own, a frame naming art that is not on disk, and a slot suppressed by
``face_overlay=false`` (an#7 review).

Every rule mirrors a rig-builder fact, and the builder imports the shared
helpers rather than restating them, so the two cannot drift:

- A bone track animates the node of the bone's **primary slot** — the slot
  named like the bone (:func:`primary_slot_per_bone`); ``bone:root.*``
  animates the entity container. A bone with no primary slot is a resolution
  error that *says so*: the old message ("no node of that name was built")
  named the symptom and left the rule for the author to guess.
- A slot track resolves to exactly **one** swap set: the set whose keys name
  every frame's attachment. Resolving frame-by-frame used to split a track
  across two channels; the runtime applies a pose's properties in name order,
  so ``blink`` never closed once a second set that sorted before ``eyelid``
  also named ``open``. Two candidates is an error naming both.
- Art is consulted when the caller can consult it (``art_exists``): a frame
  whose attachment is declared but not on disk is reported as exactly that,
  not as "no set resolves it".

>>> from cutan.characters.schema import CharacterDescriptor
>>> desc = CharacterDescriptor(name="maya")
>>> resolved = resolve_play(desc, "blink")
>>> [(t.slot, t.set_name) for t in resolved.tracks]
[('left_eye', 'eyelid'), ('right_eye', 'eyelid')]

**Motion presets (an#166).** A name the descriptor does not declare — or any
name on an entity with no descriptor (a procedural rig, a prop) — falls back
to :data:`cutan.motion.PRESETS`. The DESCRIPTOR WINS a name both know: a rig that
ships its own ``hop`` means that one. :func:`play_source` makes that call and
:func:`play_problems` gives the whole verdict, for ``an validate`` and the
compiler alike. A preset resolves to tweens, not a clip:
:func:`expand_preset_play` builds them at the moved node's pose, which the
caller reads off the built scene and the timeline before the play (an#212),
so an author never passes ``rest``.
