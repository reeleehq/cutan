"""High-level entry points: build and inspect a character.

The :func:`new_character` function wires together fetching/wrapping art,
slicing it into per-part SVGs, generating the default mouth set, and
writing a complete character directory + ``character.json`` descriptor.

Checking one is :mod:`cutan.characters.validate`'s job, not this module's — it
opens every part and reports :class:`an.verify._base.Finding` s, so a character
problem routes the way every other verifier's does (an#78).

    **Variety knobs** (every default reproduces the pre-knob character byte for
    byte, which a golden test holds):

    - ``palette`` — ``{role: "#rrggbb"}`` over :data:`PALETTE_ROLES` (``skin``,
      ``hair``, ``clothing``, ``leg``, ``accessory``) — the SAME role names a
      :class:`~an.styles.StylePack` uses. Unset roles keep the seed's colours.
      ``skin`` also paints the hands and the gaze lid; ``hair`` the brows and
      the collar. On a DiceBear head only the body follows (its face is baked).
    - ``build`` — a key of :data:`BUILDS`: ``regular``, ``squat`` (round body,
      short legs), ``tall``, ``stick`` (small blocky body, stick limbs).
    - ``head_scale`` — the head and its whole face (eyes, brows, mouths, their
      offsets, the pupil travel) scaled together, so a big head keeps its face.
    - ``hat`` — a key of :data:`HATS` (offline head only), in ``accessory``,
      worn above the brows' acting range at this head scale (an#252): lifted,
      and flattened toward its crown when lifting is not enough. A hat that
      still covers the brows (a very small head) is recorded in the
      descriptor's ``occluded``, so the character does not afford
      ``face.brows`` and expressions fall to the lids, gaze and mouth.
    - ``hair_style`` — :data:`HAIR_STYLES`: ``peak`` (the default), ``bald``,
      ``bun``, ``curly``; ``hair_length`` — :data:`HAIR_LENGTHS`: ``short``
      (the default), ``medium``, ``long`` (offline head only). Drawn in the
      ``hair`` role (the palette's ``hair`` colours them), in every view.
    - ``sash`` — a diagonal band across the torso, in ``accessory``.
    - ``views`` (an#197) — draw the turnaround: ``back``, ``side`` (a profile
      facing the viewer's right) and ``three_quarter`` beside the front, as a
      ``view`` swap set with a pose per view (:func:`add_views`), so
      :func:`cutan.motion.turn` can turn the character around. Offline head only
      (a DiceBear face is baked into its art); ignored for a DiceBear head.
      Additive: a shot that never sets a view renders exactly as without it.

    - ``feet_origin`` (an#285) — declare the rig's ``origin`` at its ROOT bone,
      the ground contact, so ``stage.at`` is where the feet stand and every
      build placed at one ``y`` stands on one line (``stage_extent``'s
      ``feet`` is then 0). Off (the default), the stage point stays the
      middle of the bones, as for every character made before it; whether
      it becomes the default is an#285's open decision.

    Every colour the factory draws in a role is recorded in the descriptor's
    ``colour_roles`` so a style pack can recolour it later (palette swapping,
    :mod:`cutan.characters.colour_roles`).

    ``gaze`` (an#99) adds the eye stack — sclera and pupil slots under each
    lid, a filled closed lid, the ``gaze_travel`` clamp — through
    :func:`add_gaze`, so `gaze_x`/`gaze_y` and the ambient saccades reach the
    pupils. Off, the eye is the single pre-stack drawing.

    ``mouth_variants`` (an#98) — ``{form: smile offset}`` — writes one more
    9-shape mouth set per form (``mouth_<shape>_<form>.svg``) and declares it
    as the ``viseme@<form>`` swap set, with its attachments in the default
    skin's ``mouth`` slot, so an expression preset preferring that form
    selects it. ``None`` means :data:`~cutan.characters.mouth_set.DEFAULT_MOUTH_VARIANTS`
    (happy, sad); ``{}`` means the neutral set only.

    Steps:

    1. Fetch a DiceBear avatar (skip if ``use_dicebear=False`` — useful for
       offline tests).
    2. Wrap it into the canonical ``an`` cutout SVG (skeleton + illustration
       groups), saved as ``<name>.svg``.
    3. Slice each part into ``parts/<part>.svg``.
    4. Write the 9-shape default mouth set into ``parts/mouth/``.
    5. Synthesize a few derived parts (open/closed eyes, brows) so the
       character is complete out of the box.
    6. Emit a ``character.json`` descriptor.

    Returns the path to the created ``character.json``.

    Raises :class:`FileExistsError` if ``out_dir/name`` already exists and
    ``overwrite=False``.

    projected onto those two slots, and a pose per view (``swap_poses``) — so
    ``{kind: set, target: <entity>, property: view, value: side}`` or
    :func:`cutan.motion.turn` turns the whole character. Idempotent. Returns the
    descriptor path.

    The views are REDRAWN from the recorded knobs (seed, palette, build, hat,
    hair style and length, sash, head scale), so it refuses a rig whose head is not this factory's
    drawing for them — a DiceBear head (its face is baked, and there is no
    back of it to draw), a promoted hand rig, or an edited head: its views are
    an illustrator's to draw, declared the same way (a ``view`` set whose keys
    name attachments on the head and torso slots, and ``swap_poses``).

    Every colour is role-tagged like the front's, so a StylePack recolours the
    views exactly as it recolours the front (an#191). The existing art is not
    touched: a shot that never sets a view renders byte-identically.
