"""Brow acting: where the brows can go, what may not draw there, and the ``face.brows`` capability.

An expression acts largely with the brows (raised in surprise, knitted in
anger, tilted in sorrow). A drawing that sits where the brows go — a hat brim
pulled down over the forehead — leaves them nothing to read against, and the
expression falls to the lids, the gaze and the mouth (an#252). So:

- **The brows' acting range** (:func:`brow_range`) is measured, not assumed:
  the factory's brow drawing, posed by every shipped expression preset through
  the default expression binding (its travel and its signs), on every view
  that shows a brow, at the character's head scale — in the offline head's
  drawing units, so it can be compared with what the head draws.
- **A hat is seated above that range** (:func:`seat_above_brows`): lifted, and
  if its crown would leave the drawing, flattened toward its crown, by one
  transform shared by every view so the hat does not change shape as the
  character turns. When even the flattest seat still overlaps — a small head
  under a tall hat — the overlap is not hidden: the factory records it in the
  descriptor's ``occluded`` (a declared fact, written by whoever KNOWS the
  geometry, like ``colour_roles``).
- **``face.brows``** is the capability the character analyser
  (:mod:`cutan.library`) derives with :func:`brow_affordance`: two brow
  slots with art on an overlay face, and nothing recorded over them. The cut-out genre's ``expression`` aspect
  requires it for its full-face method (:mod:`cutan.characters.methods`).

Hair is not measured here: since cutan#61 the brows rest below the default
hairline (:data:`BROW_DROP`; before, their outer ends
ran into the fringe and read as hair), so a hair style is held to the default
hairline instead (tests), never to the brows' range.

Units: the offline head is drawn in an :data:`HEAD_ART_SIZE` square; the rig
draws it :data:`~cutan.characters.schema.REFERENCE_HEAD_HEIGHT` × ``head_scale``
view-box units tall, hung from the neck at
:data:`~cutan.characters.schema.HEAD_ANCHOR`. The face offsets scale with the head
(``_scale_face``), so a brow's rest place in head units does not depend on the
head scale; its expression travel does (``BROW_HEIGHT_TRAVEL`` is a view-box
length), which is why a small head's brows reach higher up its forehead.

A surprised brow reaches about three head units above its rest, less on a
bigger head; a band drawn across the forehead is lifted clear of it:

>>> round(BROW_REST_TOP, 1)
25.1
>>> [round(min(brow_range(head_scale=s)["front"].values()), 1) for s in (1.0, 1.7)]
[21.8, 22.6]
>>> seat_above_brows({"front": '<rect x="20" y="20" width="40" height="4"/>'}, head_scale=1.0)
Seat(transform='translate(0 -3.18)', covers=False)
