"""User-facing character CLI subcommands.

Wired into the top-level ``an`` dispatcher via ``character_*`` dispatch-friendly
functions in :mod:`an.tools`. Each function here takes plain strings/bools
and returns a string for terminal display.

Subcommands (used as ``an character <verb> ...``):

- ``new``       — generate a fresh character from DiceBear or fallback art.
- ``add-views`` — give an offline character its turnaround (an#197).
- ``mouths``    — regenerate the 9-shape default mouth set.
- ``validate``  — completeness check.
- ``capabilities`` — what it affords, and per aspect which methods apply (an#248).
- ``silhouette``— rasterize silhouettes; for two characters, also IoU.
- ``preview``   — open an HTML viewer cycling visemes + idle animation.
