"""Whether an art package is one the compiler can actually render.

The artist-facing contract, checked offline. Wave 4 (#78) exists because the
previous check had no teeth in two separate ways:

- **It checked file existence only.** A part that was present but drew nothing
  passed, and then rendered invisibly — the one failure mode with no diagnostic
  anywhere in the pipeline (``misc/docs/wave4_research.md`` §4).
- **It returned a bespoke report type**, so the orchestrator's typed-error
  routing did not apply to any character problem. Findings here are
  :class:`an.verify._base.Finding`, the same type every verifier emits, with
  ``ir_path`` pointing at the file or slot that needs the fix.

Everything here is offline and free: no render, no browser, no network. That is
the point — an illustrator should be able to run it before delivering, and a
contract they cannot check themselves is a contract that gets them paid for work
that cannot land.
