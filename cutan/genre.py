"""The cut-out animation genre, declared as one object.

ADR 0001 §First slice: the cut-out genre's IR extensions register through the
same door any genre uses — the ``an.genres`` entry point (this distribution's
``pyproject.toml`` declares ``cutout_animation = "cutan.genre:CUTOUT"``) —
instead of being wired into the core. :data:`CUTOUT` lists:

- **action kinds** ``play`` (:mod:`cutan.characters.registration`) and
  ``expression`` (:mod:`cutan.expression.registration`);
- **entity kind** ``character``, whose nodes are stage nodes (``stage.node``);
- the **``[emotion]``** dialogue sugar;
- its **semantic checks**: ``play`` and ``expression`` resolution, brow
  acting on a character whose brows cannot act (an#252), the turn
  checks (contradicted ``from_direction``, a mouth hidden while speaking) and
  view continuity across a cut, placed in the report where they always were;
- its **capabilities** and the **character analyser** (ADR 0002:
  :mod:`cutan.library`), its **vocabulary** (motion and expression
  presets, IR-field notes: :mod:`cutan.characters.vocabulary`; the methods:
  :mod:`cutan.characters.methods`) and its **aspects**, ``locomotion``,
  ``speech`` and ``expression``, each with a default chain that ends in a
  method requiring nothing.

Its ``name`` is the persisted genre slug ``cutout_animation``, the one
:mod:`cutan.nw` declares to ``nw`` (ADR 0001 decision 9: persisted identifiers do
not change). It also offers the core **services** (:func:`an.genres.register_service`):
the ``an character`` / ``an impacts`` CLI namespaces, the ``offline`` / ``rhubarb`` /
``whisper`` lip-sync providers, the licence lookup for pre-``source`` descriptors, the
library's publish warning and the expression labels ``judge_emotion`` uses; and the
**runtime script** that draws the mouth and the eye.

Importing this module registers nothing: :func:`an.genres.load` (or
:func:`an.genres.register_genre`) does.
