"""The performance: a tempo grid, and when each impact was intended and executed.

Three times are kept apart on purpose, because scoring a sub-frame estimator is
meaningless if they blur together:

- ``t_grid`` — the INTENDED time: where the beat grid (a :class:`TempoMap`) put
  the event. What a quantiser would snap to.
- ``t_impact`` — the EXECUTED time, in continuous seconds: the grid time plus a
  humanisation offset. This is when the object actually hits (or, in the air,
  turns); the motion is built so it happens at exactly this float, never on a
  frame.
- what the frames show — not here at all; that is :mod:`cutan.impacts.truth`,
  after a :class:`an.frame_clock.FrameClock` has sampled the motion.

>>> events = perform(120, beats=4)
>>> [e.t_grid for e in events]
[0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0]
>>> all(e.t_impact == e.t_grid for e in events)   # no humanisation by default
True

A tempo change is a :class:`TempoMap` with more than one point — here an
accelerando from 60 to 120 BPM over four beats, so the gaps shrink:

>>> ts = [e.t_grid for e in perform([(0, 60), (4, 120)], beats=5, lead_in=0.0)]
>>> [round(b - a, 3) for a, b in zip(ts, ts[1:])]
[0.893, 0.729, 0.617, 0.534]
