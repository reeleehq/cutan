"""The stroke: impact events -> one continuous height curve ``h(t)``.

``h`` is the object's height above its impact position, in units of a full
stroke: ``0`` is contact (or, in the air, the turning point) and ``1`` a full
preparation. Every object in :mod:`cutan.impacts.objects` maps ``h`` AFFINELY onto
one animated property (a stick's rotation, a ball's ``y``), which is what makes
the curve below exactly the curve the renderer draws: an eased tween of the
property IS the same easing of ``h``.

The curve is a chain of :class:`StrokeSegment`\\ s built only from the
quadratic easings the cutout runtime already has, and each is chosen for its
physics:

- **surface** — the object falls with ``ease_in`` (constant acceleration, like
  gravity) and reaches ``h = 0`` at full speed, then leaves with ``ease_out``: a
  velocity reversal AT the impact. Contact is visible in position (the object
  stops at the surface) and as a kink in velocity.
- **air** — no surface. The fall is ``ease_in`` and then a short ``ease_out``
  **brake** of ``brake`` seconds that brings the object to rest at ``h = 0``;
  it then leaves with ``ease_in_out``. The executed "impact" is that turning
  point — the moment the stroke's lowest point is reached — and the peak speed
  comes ``brake`` seconds BEFORE it. The brake's distance is chosen so velocity
  is continuous into it (``d = apex * brake / fall``), so the only
  discontinuity is in acceleration — a muscle stopping a limb, not a collision.

In both kinds the speed at the peak is ``2 * apex / fall``.
