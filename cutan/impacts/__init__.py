"""Synthetic impact clips with exact ground truth, for scoring sub-frame timing.

Structured animations of simple objects — a stick or a ball — striking a
surface, or striking "the air" (a stroke that reverses with no contact), on a
known tempo grid. Each clip ships a sidecar that keeps three times apart:

- the **intended** grid time of every event (``t_grid``),
- the **executed** impact time in continuous seconds (``t_impact`` — the grid
  plus controllable humanisation, never snapped to a frame),
- and **what the frames show**: every frame's exposure interval and sample
  instants (:class:`an.frame_clock.FrameClock`: frame rate, shutter, capture
  jitter), the 2D keypoints at each frame, and which frames bracket each impact.

The clips are ordinary `an` scenes — props moved by tweens — rendered by the
cutout backend, and the ground truth is read back from the same compiled
document the renderer draws.

Quick start::

    from cutan.impacts import ImpactClipSpec, write_impact_clip, write_impact_set

    write_impact_clip(ImpactClipSpec(kind="air", fps=30, exposure=0.5,
                                     jitter_sd=0.01), "~/clips")
    write_impact_set("~/clips/set")      # 24 clips: objects x kinds x fps x shutter

Or from the shell: ``an impacts clip OUT_DIR`` / ``an impacts clip-set OUT_DIR``.

>>> plan = plan_impact_clip(ImpactClipSpec(kind="air", beats=2, tempo=60, jitter_sd=0))
>>> [(e.t_grid, e.t_impact) for e in plan.events]
[(0.5, 0.5), (1.5, 1.5)]
