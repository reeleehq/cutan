"""The placeholder rig's limbs pivot at their joint, not their centre (an#173).

A rotation of `charlie/right_arm` used to spin the rect about its middle: the
hand swung up while the top of the arm swung down into the torso, so `point`
and every other arm rotation disagreed with a descriptor rig's bone. The rig
builder now places each limb NODE at its joint and hangs the rect from it.

Asserted on the COMPILED document through the spec's own `screen_position`,
so no browser is needed:

- the joint (the rect's top-centre) does not move when the limb rotates;
- at rest the rect still covers the pixels it always did (the layout is
  unchanged; only the pivot moved);
- the `point` preset, played on the arm, keeps the shoulder put at its apex.

MUTATION: set `_LIMB_PIVOT_Y` back to `_DFLT_PIVOT_Y` in `compile.py` — the
joint assertions go red (the arm's top edge sweeps by tens of pixels).
