"""Emotion and gaze compose in the RENDERED pixels, over real pupils (an#98).

The compile-level half is `tests/test_gaze.py::test_one_expression_carries_
emotion_and_gaze_and_both_land_in_one_pose`; this is the pixel half. Four
half-second renders of one synthesized rig (eye stack included) at its first
frame — neutral, `angry` alone, a diagonal gaze alone, and ONE expression
naming both. Each contribution's changed pixels (against neutral) must reappear
in the combined frame, and the combined frame must be neither of the two
single-contribution frames. Region-free on purpose: no layout coordinates to
go stale, only set algebra on decoded pixels.

Verified on a developer machine or on a `run-browser-tests` run, not in the
default lane.

#: a lossy mp4 and the encoder differs per platform (Linux CI measured 2755
