# cutan.verify.style

Style lint: measure a render’s cadence, cut rate and palette, and compare them to a style’s targets.

“Make it in the style of X” is only checkable if X is a set of numbers. The
cut-out styles research (`misc/docs/cutout_styles_research.md`) measured six
styles with one fixed set of statistics; this module is that measurement,
ported, so an agent can render, measure the same statistics on its own output,
and adjust. The style specs that carry the `targets` ship with the package
([`cutan.styles`](cutan.styles.html.md#module-cutan.styles)): pass a style’s name (`"south_park"`), a path to a spec
file, or a mapping.

\*\*The estimators are the research’s estimators, on purpose — with one
measured exception.\*\* Every threshold below is the one the six styles were
measured with, including the ones that are crude (a noise floor at the 10th
percentile of frame differences, a cut as a colour-histogram jump). A better
estimator measures a different quantity from the one the targets were
calibrated on, and a render would then pass or miss for a reason nobody
measured. Change an estimator only together with re-measuring the targets: the
local-change rule (an#255) did, and the cadence targets of every style spec
were re-measured on the six study clips with it (the table in
`misc/docs/cutout_styles_research.md` §3). `min_changed_pixels=0` is the
research’s original estimator, unchanged.

What is measured (see [`METRICS`](#cutan.verify.style.METRICS) for the vocabulary a spec’s `targets`
may use):

- **Holds and cadence.** A frame “changes” when its mean absolute grey
  difference from the previous frame exceeds `max(0.25, 2.5 × p10)`, where
  p10 is the clip’s own 10th-percentile difference (compression noise, capped
  at 1.0 — see `NOISE_FLOOR_CAP`), **or** when at least
  `MIN_CHANGED_PIXELS` of its pixels moved by more than
  `PIXEL_CHANGE_DELTA` grey levels — a change measured on the area of
  > the moving part, not the whole frame (an#255): a frame-wide mean cannot see
  > a stick figure’s shrug or a blink in a close-up, whose few changed pixels
  > average to nothing. From
  > that: the share of frames identical to the previous one, pose changes per
  > second, and the histogram of gaps between successive changes (one frame = on
  > ones, two = on twos, three or more = threes and holds, gaps above 12 frames
  > ignored as holds rather than cadence).
- **Cuts and shot length.** For an `an` render the cuts are KNOWN — every shot
  boundary in the IR is a hard cut, because shots are concatenated — so the
  verifier takes them from the IR. Without an IR (any mp4), a cut is a frame
  whose 8×8×8 colour-histogram L1 distance exceeds 0.6 and whose mean
  difference exceeds 8; dissolves and morphs are missed, so on such footage the
  count is a floor.
- **Palette.** Mean HSV saturation, the share of dark pixels (every channel
  below 60, an outline proxy), and the coverage of the 16 most common colours
  after 4-bit quantisation (flatness), all on every 15th frame.

Not ported, deliberately: the research also measured global camera motion
(`cv2.phaseCorrelate`) and a k-means palette. Both need OpenCV or
scikit-learn, and this module adds no dependency — numpy and the ffmpeg binary
are already what `an.verify.media` uses.

A pure function over frames — [`measure_style()`](#cutan.verify.style.measure_style) — is the core, so it is
testable without ffmpeg:

```pycon
>>> import numpy as np
>>> still = np.zeros((4, 8, 8, 3), np.uint8)
>>> frames = np.concatenate([still, still + 200, still + 200, still])  # 16 frames, changes at 4 and 12
>>> m = measure_style(frames, fps=4.0, shot_durations=[4.0])
>>> m.identical_frame_share, m.pose_changes_per_s
(0.867, 0.5)
```

A target is a `[low, high]` range; a miss is a warning naming the knob that
moves it:

```pycon
>>> findings = check_targets(m, {"identical_frame_share": [0.2, 0.5]})
>>> findings[0].severity, findings[0].ir_path
('warning', '<style>/identical_frame_share')
>>> check_targets(m, {"identical_frame_share": [0.5, 0.9]})
[]
```

A target nothing measures is refused, not ignored — a spec that silently checks
less than it says is worse than one that fails to load:

```pycon
>>> check_targets(m, {"camera_shake": [0, 1]})
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: unknown style target 'camera_shake'; measurable targets are [...]
```

### cutan.verify.style.METRICS *: [dict](https://docs.python.org/3/builtins/stdtypes.html#dict)[[str](https://docs.python.org/3/builtins/stdtypes.html#str), [str](https://docs.python.org/3/builtins/stdtypes.html#str)]* *= {'cuts_per_min': 'hard cuts per minute', 'dark_pixel_share': 'share of pixels with every channel below 60', 'identical_frame_share': 'share of frames identical to the previous one (holds)', 'max_hold_frames': 'longest run of identical frames', 'mean_saturation': 'mean HSV saturation, 0..1', 'mean_shot_s': 'mean shot length in seconds', 'one_frame_interval_share': 'share of change gaps of one frame (on ones)', 'pose_changes_per_s': 'changed frames per second', 'three_plus_interval_share': 'share of change gaps of three to twelve frames', 'top16_colour_coverage': 'coverage of the 16 commonest 4-bit colours (flatness)', 'two_frame_interval_share': 'share of change gaps of two frames (on twos)'}*

every key a spec’s `targets` may use, and what it is.

* **Type:**
  The target vocabulary

### cutan.verify.style.SHOT_METRICS *: [tuple](https://docs.python.org/3/builtins/stdtypes.html#tuple)[[str](https://docs.python.org/3/builtins/stdtypes.html#str), ...]* *= ('identical_frame_share', 'pose_changes_per_s', 'one_frame_interval_share', 'two_frame_interval_share', 'three_plus_interval_share', 'max_hold_frames')*

the cadence ones, which a single static shot (a date
card, a held map) can swing for the whole clip.

* **Type:**
  The per-shot statistics

### *class* cutan.verify.style.ShotMetrics(shot, start_s, duration_s, frames, identical_frame_share, pose_changes_per_s, one_frame_interval_share, two_frame_interval_share, three_plus_interval_share, max_hold_frames)

Bases: [`object`](https://docs.python.org/3/builtins/functions.html#object)

The cadence of one shot, measured with the WHOLE clip’s change
threshold so a shot’s numbers add up to the clip’s.

### *class* cutan.verify.style.StyleLintResult(metrics, report, per_shot=<factory>)

Bases: [`object`](https://docs.python.org/3/builtins/functions.html#object)

What one lint run measured, and what it found.

`per_shot` is the cadence of each shot ([`ShotMetrics`](#cutan.verify.style.ShotMetrics)) — the
breakdown that finds which shot is holding a whole clip’s share up (a
static date card is 90% identical frames on its own).

### *class* cutan.verify.style.StyleLintVerifier(spec_or_targets, , miss_severity='warning')

Bases: [`object`](https://docs.python.org/3/builtins/functions.html#object)

Compare a render to a style spec’s `targets`. Implements `Verifier`.

The spec is a style’s name, a spec file’s path or a mapping, as for
[`style_lint()`](#cutan.verify.style.style_lint).

Shot boundaries come from the IR (every shot boundary is a cut in an `an`
render, and a dissolve’s overlap is accounted for), so `cuts_per_min` and
`mean_shot_s` are exact rather than detected. Pre-render
(`render is None`) it reports `info` and passes: it has nothing to
measure yet.

### *class* cutan.verify.style.StyleMetrics(fps, frames, duration_s, identical_frame_share, pose_changes_per_s, one_frame_interval_share, two_frame_interval_share, three_plus_interval_share, max_hold_frames, cuts, cuts_per_min, mean_shot_s, mean_saturation, dark_pixel_share, top16_colour_coverage, cut_source, change_threshold)

Bases: [`object`](https://docs.python.org/3/builtins/functions.html#object)

The statistics [`METRICS`](#cutan.verify.style.METRICS) names, measured on one clip.

#### cut_source *: [str](https://docs.python.org/3/builtins/stdtypes.html#str)*

`"shots"` (a shot list, exact) or `"pixels"`.

* **Type:**
  Where the cuts came from

### cutan.verify.style.check_targets(metrics, targets, , miss_severity='warning', live=None)

One `Finding` per target the metrics miss; `[]` when all hit.

`live` is the style spec’s `live` section. Given, each suggested fix
respects it — a style that sets `step_hz` is never told to drop it, one
that leaves it unset is never told to set it:

* **Return type:**
  [`list`](https://docs.python.org/3/builtins/stdtypes.html#list)[`Finding`]

```pycon
>>> m = measure_style(np.zeros((8, 4, 4, 3), np.uint8), fps=8.0, shot_durations=[1.0])
>>> (f,) = check_targets(m, {"identical_frame_share": [0.5, 0.7]},
...                      live={"meta": {"fps": 24, "step_hz": 12}})
>>> "drop `step_hz`" in f.suggested_fix, "keep `step_hz` at the style's 12" in f.suggested_fix
(False, True)
```

Raises `ValueError` for a target [`METRICS`](#cutan.verify.style.METRICS) does not name, or a range
that is not `[low, high]` with `low <= high`.

### cutan.verify.style.film_shots(scene)

`(shot id, seconds on screen)` per shot of an `an` render, in order.

What the lint needs to place the cuts exactly. It is the shot durations,
except where a dissolve overlaps two shots: the film is that much shorter
than their sum (`an.assemble.film_timeline()`), and each shot is
counted from where its frames start in the film.

* **Return type:**
  [`list`](https://docs.python.org/3/builtins/stdtypes.html#list)[[`tuple`](https://docs.python.org/3/builtins/stdtypes.html#tuple)[[`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/builtins/stdtypes.html#str), [`float`](https://docs.python.org/3/builtins/functions.html#float)]]

```pycon
>>> from an.ir.schema import Shot, Transition
>>> film_shots(SceneIR(timeline=[
...     Shot(id="a", duration=2.0),
...     Shot(id="b", duration=2.0, transition=Transition(kind="dissolve", duration=0.5))]))
[('a', 1.5), ('b', 2.0)]
```

### cutan.verify.style.load_style_spec(spec)

A style spec as a dict: a style’s name, a path to a spec file, or a mapping.

The rules are [`cutan.styles.resolve_style_spec()`](cutan.styles.html.md#cutan.styles.resolve_style_spec)’s (a bare name is
always the shipped spec; `./name` or `name.yaml` is a file).

* **Return type:**
  [`dict`](https://docs.python.org/3/builtins/stdtypes.html#dict)[[`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/builtins/stdtypes.html#str), [`Any`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Any)]

```pycon
>>> load_style_spec("reiniger")["style"]
'reiniger'
```

### cutan.verify.style.measure_shots(frames, , fps, shot_durations=None, shot_ids=None, min_changed_pixels=8)

Per-shot cadence ([`SHOT_METRICS`](#cutan.verify.style.SHOT_METRICS)) of `frames`, one row per shot.

The shots are `shot_durations` (seconds, in order) when given, else the
pixel cut detector’s. The step INTO each shot is the cut, not a pose
change, so it belongs to no shot. A one-frame shot has no step of its own
and measures as all-identical.

* **Return type:**
  [`list`](https://docs.python.org/3/builtins/stdtypes.html#list)[[`ShotMetrics`](#cutan.verify.style.ShotMetrics)]

```pycon
>>> import numpy as np
>>> still = np.zeros((4, 8, 8, 3), np.uint8)
>>> moving = np.stack([still[0] + 10 * i for i in range(4)])
>>> rows = measure_shots(np.concatenate([still, moving]), fps=4.0,
...                      shot_durations=[1.0, 1.0], shot_ids=["card", "map"])
>>> [(r.shot, r.identical_frame_share) for r in rows]
[('card', 1.0), ('map', 0.0)]
```

### cutan.verify.style.measure_style(frames, , fps, shot_durations=None, min_changed_pixels=8)

Measure the [`METRICS`](#cutan.verify.style.METRICS) on `frames`, an `(n, h, w, 3)` uint8 RGB array.

`shot_durations` (seconds, in order) gives the cuts exactly; without it the
pixel cut detector is used. Ratios are rounded to three decimals.
`min_changed_pixels` is the local-change rule’s size (`0`: the research’s
frame-wide estimator alone, which the targets were first measured with).

* **Return type:**
  [`StyleMetrics`](#cutan.verify.style.StyleMetrics)

```pycon
>>> import numpy as np
>>> f = np.zeros((6, 4, 4, 3), np.uint8)
>>> f[1::2] = 255                       # a change on every frame
>>> m = measure_style(f, fps=6.0, shot_durations=[1.0])
>>> m.identical_frame_share, m.one_frame_interval_share, m.cuts
(0.0, 1.0, 0)
```

### cutan.verify.style.measure_video(mp4, , shot_durations=None, width=320, height=180)

Decode `mp4` at the research’s scale and [`measure_style()`](#cutan.verify.style.measure_style) it.

* **Return type:**
  [`StyleMetrics`](#cutan.verify.style.StyleMetrics)

### cutan.verify.style.project_of_render(mp4)

The project directory an `an` render sits in — `<project>/output/x.mp4`
beside `<project>/ir/scene.json` — or `None` for any other video.

* **Return type:**
  [`Path`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path) | [`None`](https://docs.python.org/3/builtins/constants.html#None)

### cutan.verify.style.style_lint(mp4, spec_or_targets, , shot_durations=None, scene=None, miss_severity='warning')

Measure `mp4` and compare it to a style spec’s `targets`.

`spec_or_targets` is a style’s name (`"south_park"`), a spec file’s
path, a spec mapping, or a bare `targets` mapping ([`load_style_spec()`](#cutan.verify.style.load_style_spec)).

The cuts are exact when the shots are known: pass `scene` (a project
directory, a `scene.json`, or a `SceneIR`; dissolve overlaps are
accounted for) or `shot_durations`. Without either, cuts are detected
from pixels, which misses a cut between two shots on the same backdrop and
every dissolve — the lint says so in its report.

Suggested fixes respect the spec’s `live` settings ([`check_targets()`](#cutan.verify.style.check_targets)).

A decode or probe failure is reported at
`an.verify.vision.FAILURE_SEVERITY`, never as `info` — a lint that
could not run must not read as a clean one. A malformed spec raises: that is
the caller’s error, not the video’s.

* **Return type:**
  [`StyleLintResult`](#cutan.verify.style.StyleLintResult)
