"""Render one short clip per shipped capability, and write the gallery that explains them.

A feature nobody can see is a feature nobody believes. This builds a fixed set of
**self-contained** demo projects — every character is synthesized offline, every scene is
authored here — renders each to mp4, converts each to a GIF that survives GitHub's markdown,
and emits ``GALLERY.md`` naming, per demo, the exact command / argument / code that makes it
happen.

Deliberately **not** the bench corpus. The corpus exists to make a deliberate degradation
move a declared number; these exist to be looked at. Sharing scenes between the two would
make one of them a hostage of the other.

Offline and free by construction: ``use_dicebear=False`` (no network, and no CC-BY style to
attribute) and ``tts="offline"`` (no paid API — this script must stay runnable by an
unattended agent that happens to have keys in its environment).

Run::

    python misc/demos/build_demos.py                # everything
    python misc/demos/build_demos.py lipsync camera # named demos only

    Nothing about the scene changes — same rig, same backdrop, same timing.
    What changes is a single `style_pack:` line in the meta block.

    **The procedural rig is DECLARED rather than fallen into.** When this demo
    was written a pack could not reach inside a drawing, so the procedural rig
    was the only rig it could repaint. Since the factory tags its colours
    (`colour_roles`), a `new_character` rig is repainted too; the demo keeps the
    procedural rig so its clip is unchanged.

    Declaring it follows `an.bench.corpus._declare_procedural_rig`, for the
    same an#33 reason: the store entry lists exactly `_PLACEHOLDER_PARTS`, the
    list the fallback would have used, so the compiled tree and every pixel are
    identical — what changes is that the scene records
    `resolved: "parts", fallback: false` instead of tripping the stand-in
    warning. A clip whose whole subject is "these two frames differ for exactly
    one reason" must not carry a second, unstated reason in a warning the
    gallery reader never sees.

    `_PLACEHOLDER_PARTS` is a head, a torso and two arms — no legs — so `leg`
    is unreachable ON THIS RIG and the pack does not declare it: a worked
    example a reader copies should not ship an entry that does nothing.
    `pupil` is a different case and the caption keeps them apart. It IS
    reachable here — the compiler stamps the eye's colour (`compile.py`'s
    `kind="eye"` visual) and the rig has eyes — so leaving it out is a choice
    about what the clip shows, not a limit. Saying "cannot show" of both was
    the second overclaim this demo's caption carried.
