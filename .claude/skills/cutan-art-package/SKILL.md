description: The artist-facing contract for an `an` character — folder layout, the skeleton, required parts, slot and attachment conventions, licence fields — and how to check a delivery offline before anyone is paid for it. Use when commissioning, reviewing, receiving, or authoring character art; when writing a brief for an illustrator; or when `an character validate` reports something.

# Commissioning and receiving character art

**Do not hand-write the contract. Generate it:**

```bash
an character contract
```

It is derived from `cutan/characters/schema.py` and from the checks in
`cutan/characters/validate.py`, so it cannot drift from what the validator
enforces. This skill is the *why* and the review workflow; that command is the
*what*, and it is the thing to paste into a brief.

**Why this skill did not exist until Wave 4.** A contract the compiler ignores
is worse than no contract, because it gets a human illustrator paid for work
that cannot land. Until #73/#74/#75 the compiler read three descriptor fields
and built every character from seven module constants — `bones`, `slots`,
`skins` and `view_box` had no consumer *and no producer*. Art that arrived
correct rendered identically to art that did not. The epic withheld this skill
on purpose until that stopped being true.

## The one-minute version

```
<name>/
  character.json     the descriptor — bones, slots, skins, asset_sets
  <name>.svg         the canonical drawing, containing <g id="skeleton">
  parts/             one SVG — or PNG — per attachment
    mouth/           the viseme set
```

```bash
an character validate <name> --out-dir <parent>   # offline, free, no render
```

Every finding names the file and what to do. `error` blocks a render; `warning`
renders but is worth fixing.

## Raster parts (an#211)

A part may be a **PNG with alpha** (or JPEG/WebP) instead of an SVG — the
route for art carved from a scan or a video frame, which would lose its
shading if traced. Point the attachment's `path` at it (`parts/head.png`);
a required part may ship in either format. Rules, all checked by
`an character validate`:

- **Ship the raster as its own part file, never inside an SVG.** `<image>` in
  an SVG part stays refused: it hides the pixels from every check, and its
  rendering depends on the rasteriser.
- **Cut it out.** A part with no alpha channel draws its whole rectangle,
  background included (warning); a fully transparent part draws nothing
  (error); an unreadable file is an error.
- **Size is pixels × the rig's one uniform scale** by default — one pixel is
  one view_box unit, exactly as an SVG part's `width`/`height` are. **A
  declared size wins** (an#220): an attachment's `width` and/or `height`, in
  view_box units, sizes the part whatever its pixel count, so art carved at
  any resolution needs no resampling. Declare ONE of the two and the other
  follows the art's aspect; declare both and the art is contained in the box
  (uniformly scaled, never stretched — `an character validate` warns when the
  two aspects disagree).
- **Not recolourable.** A StylePack's colour roles reach tagged SVG literals;
  a raster's colours are pixels, so it renders as drawn (the compiler says so
  once; a `colour_roles` entry on a `.png` is a warning). Outline and shadow
  treatments still apply — they are copies of the part.
- **Addressed by content.** The texture alias carries the file's digest, so a
  re-carved part is a new texture and a new compiled document; nothing is
  fetched over a network.
- **Swap keys may be on different canvases.** Each key of a swap set (visemes,
  eyelids, views) is drawn with its OWN box, anchor and offset — a closed
  mouth on a thin canvas no longer squashes the open ones. Same for SVG.
- **Carve with `cutan.carve`, not a script of your own** (`pip install "cutan[carve]"`): `carve(frame, matte=..., point=...)` for a part, `carve_head(...)` for a head (neck cut under the jaw, 512² canvas, the face centre as the origin), `split_parts` for moving pieces with pivots, `write_prop` for the folder. On flat cartoon frames the default `flat_colour` key (or `Polygon(outline) & FlatColour()`) beats `rembg`; `grabcut` for one prop in a rough box; `rembg` for photos. Read `part.quality.warnings()` before using a part. `frame_source(url, t=..., license=...)` carries the provenance into the descriptor.
- **Record provenance.** Art carved from footage you do not own is
  `license: "all-rights-reserved"` (or the free-text "all rights reserved —
  private study only"): `an credits` lists it under **NOT PUBLISHABLE** and a
  render using it ends with a warning. Never record a permissive licence you
  do not hold. A part carved from ANOTHER clip than the rest carries its own
  `source` on its attachment (an#220) — `an credits` lists each part by path.

## Views that draw the face differently (an#220)

A profile head carved with its eye and mouth in it is the trap: hiding the
face slots in `swap_poses` makes blinks and lip-sync vanish in profile. Carve
the profile's eye and mouth out as parts and declare them as **per-view
sets**: `eyelid@side` → `{OPEN: open_side, CLOSED: closed_side}` (attachments
on both eye slots) and `viseme@side` → the profile's nine mouth shapes (on the
mouth slot). The compiler uses them whenever `side` is in force — any view key
works (`eyelid@back`). `an validate` warns when a line is spoken in a view
that hides the mouth.

Two more declared facts about carved art, both in `character.json`:

- **`rest_view`** — the view the default art is drawn in, when it is not the
  front: a figure carved only in profile says `"side"`, and `walk` swings its
  legs without being told.
- **`gait`** — `"hem"` when the leg slots are the two halves of a robe's hem
  (a walk tilts them and sways the body). Leave it unset for a figure with
  nothing to step with: it glides (the chain's default); `"rock"`, `"hop"`,
  `"bounce"` and `"waddle"` are characterisations to ask for.

## The four things that actually matter

### 1. Aspect ratio is intrinsic to the art

The compiler places a part and scales it **uniformly**. It will never stretch a
drawing to fit a box, and there is no box to fit: a part's size is its own
extent, scaled by one factor shared with every other part.

So **draw each part at its true relative size**. A part exported at the wrong
scale is now visibly wrong rather than silently corrected.

Corollary for the exporter: a part's `width`/`height` must match its `viewBox`
extent. If they disagree the art is letterboxed inside its own texture — it
renders small, centred, in a mostly-empty raster. `an character validate`
reports it; before Wave 4 an arm drew 4 px of ink in a 28 px slot this way.

### 2. The skeleton is the rig

Draw `<g id="skeleton">` containing one named `<circle>` per joint. Those
coordinates **become the bone positions** — `an character contract` lists which
joint each bone reads (`head` ← `neck`, `arm_l` ← `shoulder_l`, and so on).

A drawing with no skeleton still works; it gets a generic rig, which is almost
never what the art wants. A partial skeleton improves the rig rather than
breaking it: bones with no matching joint keep their default placement.

**A joint id must not also be a part id.** Extraction resolves the collision by
preferring the group, which is a rule the drawing does not show.

### 3. A slot's name is its node name; an attachment's name is not

Two namespaces, deliberately:

- **Slot** — where a thing is drawn (`left_eye`, `mouth`, `torso`). This is the
  scene-graph node name, and it is what `scene.md` targets.
- **Attachment** — *which* drawing (`mouth_a`, `brow_l`). Usually follows the
  files — except where one swap set must drive several slots at once: both eye
  slots name their attachments `open`/`closed` (paths still `eye_l_open.svg`
  etc.) so the single `eyelid` set projects onto each (an#87).

A slot holds several attachments and shows one at a time. That is how a mouth
carries nine visemes, and how an eye carries open and closed.

`asset_sets[channel][key]` maps a *key* to an attachment name — `viseme.A` →
`mouth_a`. Keep it: a key is not a filename, and real mouth charts are
many-to-one (roughly ten drawings carrying forty phonemes), so collapsing them
makes the first shared drawing a schema change instead of a data change.

### 4. Provenance is not optional if the art was acquired

Populate `source`. `None` means *we made this* — a claim, not a shrug. A licence
defect is the only failure that reaches backwards through finished work: a video
shipped with an unattributed CC BY asset cannot be un-shipped. See
`an-dev-licensing`. Recognised classes: attribution (CC BY family), free
(`cc0-*`, `pd`/`public-domain`/`cc-pdm-1.0`, MIT/BSD/Apache), **private**
(`all-rights-reserved…`, `private-study…` — not publishable), and unknown
(anything else — reported UNVERIFIED).

## Reviewing a delivery

1. `an character validate <name>` — fix every `error`, read every `warning`.
2. `an character silhouette <name>` — is it readable as a shape?
3. `an character preview <name>` — visemes and idle, in a browser.
4. Render one shot and **look at it**. Three layout bugs in Wave 4's own build
   were invisible in every metric and obvious in a frame.

## What the validator cannot tell you

- **Whether the drawing is any good.** It checks that art *can* render, not that
  it *should*.
- **Whether a part is the right part.** A torso in `head.svg` passes everything.
- **Whether the skeleton matches the drawing.** Joints are read as coordinates;
  a shoulder pivot drawn at the elbow yields a rig that is valid and wrong.
- **Sub-pixel or stylistic consistency across a set.** That is `lookbook`'s
  problem, not this one's.

## Traps

- **A part that draws nothing passes every existence check.** That is the whole
  reason `validate` opens files now; `tests/fixtures/art/invisible_head.svg` is
  the regression fixture, and it is deliberately not empty.
- **A degenerate part hangs the render, it does not fail it** — `<svg/>`,
  malformed XML, or a zero-dimension root make the asset loader never settle.
  There is a deadline now (#79), but the art is still wrong.
- **A missing part is audible, not fatal, by default.** Pass
  `strict_assets=True` when you are measuring pixels. A slot that still draws
  *something* — open eyes but no closed ones — is reported as incomplete and is
  deliberately **not** a fallback, so a rig without a blink still renders.
- **`REQUIRED_PARTS` includes both eye states.** Both committed corpus rigs are
  missing the closed ones, so a validate on them fails honestly today.
